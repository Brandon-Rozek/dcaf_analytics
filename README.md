# DCAF Analytics

This repo is for sharing analysis code of anonymized data from
[DARIA](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management). 

## To contribute

@alisonnjones sets the analytics agenda for this team, so please check with
her before working on projects.

Please put your analysis code in the `analytics/` folder.

If you are a member of the analysts team of DCAFEngineering, feel free to
push to a branch in this repo or fork and pull request, whatever you're
most comfortable with.
[Github's very good how-to guide to pull requests is here.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
Please reach out to @colinxfleming if you have any questions about any
of the above, as git is kinda counterintuitive magic the first couple of
times you use it.
